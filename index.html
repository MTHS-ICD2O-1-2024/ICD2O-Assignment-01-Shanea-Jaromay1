    <p>Lynn Conway's contribution to computer science</p>
    <p>
      Following her transition, Conway adopted a new name and identity and
      restarted her career. She worked at Xerox PARC from 1973 to 1983, where
      she led the "LSI Systems" group. She initiated the Mead-Conway VLSI chip
      design revolution in very large-scale integrated (VLSI) microchip design,
      which reshaped the field of microchip design during the 1980s.

    <p>
      Conway joined the University of Michigan as a professor of electrical
      engineering and computer science in 1985. She retired from active teaching
      and research in 1998 as professor emerita. Conway began publicly
      discussing her gender transition in 1999 and was a transgender activist
      until her death in 2024.

    <p>Lynn Conway's contribution to computer science</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        VLSI Chip Design Revolution: She initiated the Mead-Conway VLSI chip
        design revolution, which greatly simplified and democratized microchip
        design. Co-authored the influential textbook "Introduction to VLSI
        Systems" with Carver Mead. Developed scalable design rules that
        simplified chip design.
      </li>
      <li>
        Contributions to Computer Architecture: Invented generalized dynamic
        instruction handling, a key advancement in out-of-order execution used
        in modern processors, while at IBM.
      </li>
      <li>
        Development of Infrastructure: Created multi-project wafers (MPW)
        technology. Invented an internet-based infrastructure for rapid
        prototyping and short-run fabrication of chip designs, contributing to
        the "fabless-design + silicon-foundry" industrial paradigm.
      </li>
      <li>
        Educational Impact: Pioneered and taught VLSI design courses,
        significantly impacting computer science and electrical engineering
        education
      </li>
    </ul>
